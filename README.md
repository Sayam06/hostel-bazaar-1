<h2 align='center'>A microserviced e-commerce application.</h2><br/>

## 📚 | Introduction

- Hostel Bazaar is an e-commerce application built with microservices in mind.
- It uses Redis as a cache, and MongoDB as a NoSQL database.
- It uses express-gateway that acts as a API Gateway for the microservices.
- It uses RabbitMQ as a message broker for asynchronous communication between microservices.

### _**Disclaimer**_

- This is a demo application of an E-commerce application following the guidelines of the [Microservices Architecture](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) pattern.

<br/>

## ⌛ | Let's talk about Microservices
- **Scalability:** Microservices allow for easier scaling as each service can be scaled independently based on its load. In contrast, monolithic applications have to be scaled as a whole.

- **Resilience:** Microservices offer better resilience as if one service fails, other services can continue to operate normally. In contrast, if a monolithic application fails, the entire system fails.

- **Flexibility:** Microservices allow for flexibility in technology stacks as each service can use a different stack based on its specific requirements. In contrast, monolithic applications have to use the same technology stack throughout the application.

- **Continuous Deployment::** Microservices make continuous deployment easier as each service can be deployed independently. In contrast, monolithic applications have to be deployed as a whole, which can be more complex and time-consuming.

- **Easy maintenance:** Microservices make maintenance easier as each service can be maintained and updated independently. In contrast, monolithic applications require more effort and coordination to maintain and update.
