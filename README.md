## 📚 | Introduction

- Hostel Bazaar is an e-commerce application built with microservices in mind.
- It uses Redis as a cache, and MongoDB as a NoSQL database.
- It uses express-gateway that acts as a API Gateway for the microservices.
- It uses RabbitMQ as a message broker for asynchronous communication between microservices.

### _**Disclaimer**_

- This is a demo application of an E-commerce application following the guidelines of the [Microservices Architecture](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) pattern.
